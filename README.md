# Third-Person-Character-Utility-Mixamo-Manequin-Man

This utility consists of a ready to used third-person character with movement, camera and animations

This utility makes use of the Basic Character Movement Component and the Camera Controller Component.

The movement of this character is configured to be carried out by the cursors and the rotation of the camera by the x-axis mouse's movement and the zoom of the camera by the middle button wheel of the mouse, although it can be configured to your liking by configuring the components mentioned above.

The model used is the male mannequin from mixamo, the animations used also come from mixamo.com

This utility has been tested in https://jocarpe.itch.io/third-person-character-demo

This is a demo in continuous development to test all the components developed and in the process of future development.

It also adds the ability to change characters and view resource consumption via a plugin.

A detailed explanation of how the demo works is available on the itch.io page indicated.

Feel free to check it out in either of its two versions, Windows or Linux.
